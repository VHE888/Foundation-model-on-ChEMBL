# Foundation Model Development with ChEMBL

This project prepares datasets from the **ChEMBL database** for pre-training **foundation models** in drug discovery and cheminformatics.  


The goal is to enable large-scale molecular representation learning and provide a strong foundation for downstream tasks such as property prediction, virtual screening, and drug design.
